# Emotracker Pack for OOTMMR

This is a work in progress!

Big thanks to [Hamsda](https://github.com/Hamsda/EmoTrackerPacks) and Pink Switch who let me use their OOTR/MMR tracker packs as the base for this tracker pack.

I'm currently on [OOTMMR](https://github.com/OoTMM/core) v1.2.0 until the logic overhaul is done. After that I will update the logic to the most recent release.

Things that need to be done:

- [x] Logic for OOT
- [x] Logic for MM Clock Town
- [x] Logic for MM Swamp and Milk Road
- [x] Logic for MM Snowhead
- [x] Logic for MM Great Bay
- [x] Logic for MM Ikana Castle
- [ ] Logic for MM major dungeons
- [x] Logic for MM Moon
- [ ] Add Seahorse and Eggs as Checks
- [ ] Fix layout
- [ ] Update logic to the current stable version of the randomizer
- [ ] Add settings that were added after v1.2.0
- [ ] Add tricks that were added after v1.2.0
- [ ] Delete unused images
- [ ] Delete unused lua/json parts
- [ ] General cleanup
