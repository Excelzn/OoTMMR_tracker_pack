# EmoTracker Pack (map + items) for OoTMM

## Usage

- Install [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/download/).
- [Download the current tracker pack version](https://github.com/jupiter0fire/OoTMMR_tracker_pack/releases/latest/download/OoTMMR_tracker_pack.zip) from [releases](https://github.com/jupiter0fire/OoTMMR_tracker_pack/releases) and place the `OoTMMR_tracker_pack.zip` in the "packs" subfolder in your `[user]/Documents/EmoTracker` folder. If you have not used EmoTracker before, it is safe to manually create the "packs" folder.
- Open EmoTracker and select "OotMM Randomizer" under `"Installed Packages" -> "Others"` in the settings menu.

Green markings indicate that a check is logically reachable. Yellow markings mean that the check is reachable with a trick that is not enabled in the settings. Orange markings indicate that at a location some checks are reachable and others are not.

## Notes

- The events for **OOT Malon**, **OOT Zelda's Letter**, **MM Bomber's Notebook**, **MM Seahorse**, **MM Zora Eggs** and **MM Frogs** are depicted as locations in the tracker pack and must be manually tracked before the checks that depend on these events are shown as reachable (e.g. checks in Pinnacle Rock depending on getting MM Seahorse).

- **Goron Lullaby** is a progressive item with two stages: First Half of Goron Lullaby and Full Goron Lullaby.

- **MM Hookshot** is a progressive item with two stages: MM Short Hookshot and MM Hookshot.

- If you are playing with MM Full Lullaby Only or without MM Short Hookshot, simply click twice on the corresponding symbols once you have found the respective item.

- **Small Key Sanity** is a tracker setting because OOT Fire Temple logic depends on that setting. You still need to track your Small Keys manually even if Small Key Sanity is not activated.

- Having **MM Spin Attack** can be tracked by right clicking on the MM Kokiri Sword.

## Unsupported Settings

- Dungeon Reward Shuffle Anywhere
- Boss Entrance Shuffle
- Dungeon Entrance Shuffle
- Cross Games OoT Warp Songs
- MQ Dungeons

## TODOs:

- [ ] Delete unused lua/json parts
